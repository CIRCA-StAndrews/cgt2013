<p>
A good first stop on exploring the town would be the St Andrews Tourist Information Centre on Market Street. Near the fountain in the 
cobbled section of the street.
</p>

<p>
<b>Walking and exploring the town</b>
<ul>
<li>The East, Castle and West Sands beaches, via the harbour, cathedral and castle. Recreate the 'Chariots of Fire' beach run on the West Sands for yourself!
<li>Much of the older town is University buildings - the St Leonard's, St Salvator's and St Mary's quads are very attractive. In the 
latter is a tree planted by Queen Mary.
<li>You can explore the <a href="http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_249&amp;PropName=St%20Andrews%20Cathedral" class="external text" rel="nofollow">St Andrews Cathedral</a>
 grounds for free but for a view from St Rule's tower we recommend the joint cathedral and castle entry fee. 
<li><a href="http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=pl_248&amp;PropName=St%20Andrews%20Castle" class="external text" rel="nofollow">St Andrews Castle</a> has some interesting features including a toilet over the sea, a 
rather nasty prison cell and a siege mine into which you can crawl.
<li>While walking around the town, visit the famous Janetta's Ice Cream shop on South Street - long queues are testament to the 
popularity and amazing collection of flavours.
<li>There are many pubs and restaurants - ask a local. We like the Whey Pat for a drink after work and may meet there informally some
evenings after talks are finished.
<li>Lade Braes and the Botanic Gardens. Off the beaten track for tourists but much loved by locals. See maps of St Andrews.
<li>Look up 'The Fife Coastal Path' - an ambitious walk... but you could take the bus back.
</ul>
