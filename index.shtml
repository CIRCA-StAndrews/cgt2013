<h3>The Course</h3> 
<p align=justify>
  This LMS/EPSRC Short Instructional Course in Computational Group Theory 
  is organised by the University of St Andrews and the 
  London Mathematical Society.
  It will take place between
  <b>Sunday 28th July</b> (arrival day) and
  <b>Friday 2nd August 2013</b> (departure day).
  The talks will happen from 29th July to 2nd August 2013
  (inclusive). This course is run in the week immediately preceding 
  <a href="http://www.groupsstandrews.org/2013/">Groups St Andrews 2013</a> in St Andrews.

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Ever since their invention in the last century, computers have been
used to study groups. During the past few decades this subject area
has matured into the research field of Computational Group Theory,
which aims to develop, analyse and implement algorithms to work with
groups on a computer. Researchers in many are as (Algebra,
Combinatorics, Number Theory to name but a few) have to solve concrete
problems for groups or want to test conjectures involving
groups. Computational Group Theory has evolved as a standard tool for
them, but successfully applying the available software often requires
some knowledge of the algorithms to ask the right question. Thus
knowledge of Computational Group Theory techniques is a useful tool
for many graduate students, even if their research is not exactly in
this area.</p>

<h3 id="objectives-of-the-course">Objectives of the Course</h3>
<p>This course will introduce students to the four main areas of
Computational Group Theory: permutation groups, soluble and <span
class="math"><em>p</em></span>-groups, matrix groups and finitely
presented groups. We will cover typical problems and standard
algorithms, along with the analysis of these algorithms and their
practical use on a computer. In the practical sessions there will be
some emphasis on using the computer algebra system
<a href="http://www.gap-system.org">GAP</a>, a world wide open
source project established in 1988. After this course the participants
will have a good understanding of what computers can and cannot do
with groups and will be able to use  to answer their own group
theoretic questions. We aim to appeal to a broad spectrum of students
from areas such as Algebra, Topology, Combinatorics and Graph
Theory.</p>

LMS/EPSRC Short Courses aim to provide training for postgraduate students in core areas of mathematics.  Part of their success is the opportunity for students to meet other students working in related areas as well as the chance to meet a number of leading experts in the topic.
