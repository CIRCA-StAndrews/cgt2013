<h3>Accommodation</h3>
If you are using the course accommodation in McIntosh Hall and are staying on to attend 
<a href="http://www.groupsstandrews.org/2013">Groups St Andrews 2013</a> then you need to have booked
and paid for the night of Friday August 2nd, which is not part of the standard accommodation
package for either event. If you are in that situation, contact the local organisers asap, by email
to <a href="mailto:cgt2013@mcs.st-and.ac.uk">cgt2013@mcs.st-and.ac.uk</a> or in person at the course
on Monday.
</p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>
Lectures and Lab sessions will take place in the Mathematical Institute - building 14 (square F3) on 
<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/university/maps/wwwmap.pdf">this map</a>.
</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
The first talk is scheduled for 09.00 on Monday morning. A registration / information desk will be open 
from 08.45 in the area
outside the course lecture theatre (signposted in the Institute) on level three of the building. Participants can
register, pick up login details, etc, throughout the morning or at any time via an organiser.
</p>

<h3>Computer facilities</h3>
<p>
Participants bringing their own laptop are encouraged to configure (in advance) and use Eduroam, if it is available to them. 
We cannot arrange Eduroam access for participants who do not have it configured in advance at their home institution
but will in such cases provide visitor access to local wifi.
</p>

<p>
Lab sessions will run in a University computer lab. The PCs in the lab can be accessed by participants using a guest
login account available from the organisers. These PCs have an ssh client 'PuTTY' which can then be used to access
local servers running GAP. Login details for the local servers will be provided by announcement during the first lab
session.
</p>

<h3>Lecture materials</h3>
Will be added gradually as they become available. See the
<a href="./lectures.shtml">Lectures and Worksheets page</a> on this site.

<h3>Special Lectures</h3>
<p>
The special lectures will be as follows:<br>
Tuesday, 2pm: "Distributed Computations with GAP", Alexander Konovalov (St Andrews)<br>
Thursday, 2pm: "Algorithmic Generalisations of Small Cancellation Theory", Richard Parker
</p>

<h3>Extra Sessions</h3>
<p>
Thanks to feedback provided by the participants, we have arranged to offer two additional sessions. These sessions
will run in the lecture theatre in parallel to the lab session on Thursday afternoon. Obviously, attendance at
either extra session or the lab session is entirely optional.
</p>

<p>
Alexander will first (3.30pm) give an introductory talk on the subject of "How to Write a GAP Package". At 4pm,
Max Neunh√∂ffer will introduce "GAP Types, Objects and Method Selection".
</p>

<p>
Further suggestions provided by participant feedback will be addressed during the lab session.
</p>

<h3>Travel Grants</h3>
<p>
The LMS has some small grants available to non-UK postgraduates to partially fund their travel to this course. The organisers are
required to recommend applicants for these grants to the LMS. We would like to hear from eligible participants who are in some way 
'self-funded' as we would prefer to recommend people in such situations, for these grants. Please speak to John McDermott or Angela Miguel 
- or send email explaining your circumstances to the course address. We need to hear from you asap!
</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p>
The course dinner is on Tuesday evening. Note that the time of <b>7pm</b> has been brought forward compared to the 
first version of
the timetable. The location is "Zizzi's" restaurant on South St. See the following map:<br>

<h4>What to do in St Andrews</h4>
<p>
Wednesday afternoon is left free to explore St Andrews - or further afield! We gather a few suggestions in the 
<a href="./whattodohere.shtml">Things to do in St Andrews</a> page. If you are interested
in any of these - particularly those for which we have not yet provided links - please just chat to one of the local organisers.
